# ckb-js-toolkit-contrib

Utilities that are built on top of [ckb-js-toolkit](https://github.com/xxuejie/ckb-js-toolkit). The code contained here are considered more experimental than ckb-js-toolkit. More features are provided, in addition, code incompatibilities might happen with newer versions. You can think of this as a testbed for ideas in aiding CKB dapp development in JavaScript. When code here becomes more stable, we might move them to ckb-js-toolkit.

For now, this library contains raw JS files in ECMAScript module format. If you need other formats(e.g.: commonjs to use in node), please introduce your own transpiler.
